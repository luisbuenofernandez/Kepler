        "answer": "When I have multiple deadlines to meet, I prioritize my work by first assessing the urgency and importance of each task. Here’s my approach: \n \n1. Create a Task List: I start by listing all the tasks that need to be completed. This helps me get a clear overview of everything that needs to be done. \n \n2. Prioritize Tasks: I prioritize tasks based on their deadlines and importance, using the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize them. For example, during a previous project, I identified tasks related to client deliverables as urgent and important, while internal documentation was important but not urgent. \n \n3. Set Deadlines: I set specific deadlines for each task, even if they don’t have strict external deadlines. This helped me during a major project where setting internal deadlines ensured steady progress and timely completion. \n \n4. Break Down Tasks: I break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. This approach was particularly useful when I was working on a complex web development project, allowing me to tackle it step-by-step and track progress. \n \n5.

Communicate: If I foresee any potential delays, I communicate with my team or supervisors early on. During a previous role, early communication about potential bottlenecks helped us manage client expectations and secure additional resources when needed. By following these steps, I effectively manage my workload, ensure timely completion of tasks, and maintain high productivity.",

To handle this, I first took the time to understand their perspective and working style by initiating an open conversation. I expressed my appreciation for their flexibility and creativity, which often brought new ideas to the table. At the same time, I shared my own approach and the benefits of having a structured plan. \n \n We agreed to find a middle ground that leveraged both of our strengths. For example, we implemented short daily check-ins to ensure we were aligned on priorities and deadlines, while still allowing space for spontaneous brainstorming sessions. This compromise not only improved our collaboration but also enhanced our overall team performance. \n \n Through this experience, I learned the importance of empathy, active listening, and flexibility when working with diverse team members. it reinforced my belief that effective communication and mutual respect are key to overcoming differences and achieving common goals.

        "answer": "During my programming course, we had a project with a very tight deadline to create a fully functional web application in just two weeks. To manage this, I broke down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and created a detailed timeline using project management software to track our progress. I collaborated closely with my team, ensuring that we communicated effectively and supported each other. We had daily check-ins to monitor our progress and address any issues that arose promptly. \n \n One specific challenge we faced was a major bug in the application a few days before the deadline. We held an emergency meeting to brainstorm solutions and worked extra hours to resolve the issue. Despite the tight deadline, we successfully completed the project on time and received positive feedback from our instructor. This experience taught me the importance of effective time management, teamwork, and maintaining a clear focus under pressure. I believe these skills will be valuable in any fast-paced work environment.",

        "answer": "When I have multiple deadlines to meet, I prioritize my work by first assessing the urgency and importance of each task. Here’s my approach: \n \n1. Create a Task List: I start by listing all the tasks that need to be completed. This helps me get a clear overview of everything that needs to be done. \n \n2. Prioritize Tasks: I prioritize tasks based on their deadlines and importance, using the Eisenhower Matrix to categorize them. For example, during a previous project, I identified tasks related to client deliverables as urgent and important, while internal documentation was important but not urgent. \n \n3. Set Deadlines: I set specific deadlines for each task, even if they don’t have strict external deadlines. This helped me during a major project where setting internal deadlines ensured steady progress and timely completion. \n \n4. Break Down Tasks: I break down larger tasks into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. This approach was particularly useful when I was working on a complex web development project, allowing me to tackle it step-by-step and track progress. \n \n5. Use Tools: I use project management software like Trello and Asana to schedule tasks and set reminders. These tools were invaluable during my programming course, helping me stay organized and ensure no deadlines were missed. \n \n6. Stay Flexible: I stay flexible and adjust my plan as needed. For instance, if a high-priority task emerges, I re-prioritize my list to accommodate the new deadline. \n \n7. Communicate: If I foresee any potential delays, I communicate with my team or supervisors early on. During a previous role, early communication about potential bottlenecks helped us manage client expectations and secure additional resources when needed. By following these steps, I effectively manage my workload, ensure timely completion of tasks, and maintain high productivity.",

        "answer": "One time, during my programming course with Ceibal, we faced a significant challenge where our project required integrating several different technologies that weren’t inherently compatible. Initially, we struggled to find a straightforward solution that would allow these technologies to communicate effectively without compromising performance. To tackle this, I proposed creating a middleware that could serve as a bridge between the different technologies. After researching potential solutions, I suggested using Node.js for its asynchronous capabilities, which would help in handling multiple requests efficiently. We discussed it as a team, and I took the lead in designing and implementing the middleware. The middleware successfully resolved the compatibility issue and even improved our project's overall performance by 20%, according to our performance benchmarks. \n \n This experience taught me the importance of creative problem-solving and thinking outside the box. it also highlighted the value of collaboration and leveraging each team member's strengths to overcome challenges. I believe these skills are crucial in any role and I look forward to applying and further developing them in my future career.

This has been developed through continuous learning and meditation over the past three years. When receiving feedback, I always hope it comes from a place of respect and a desire to help improve, which is how I communicate with others. \n \n When it comes to negative feedback or constructive criticism, I strive to be very open to listening, as it is important to be open to learning and growth. Even if the feedback may be difficult to hear, I recognize that it can often be my ego feeling offended. it may take some time to regain mental clarity, but once I do, I can objectively see the positive contribution of that feedback, which exists to help me grow and evolve.",

        "answer": "During my time working at Banco República, I encountered a challenging situation where I had to collaborate with a team member who had a very different working style and approach to tasks. This team member preferred a more spontaneous and flexible way of working, while I tend to be more structured and organized. To handle this, I first took the time to understand their perspective and working style by initiating an open conversation. I expressed my appreciation for their flexibility and creativity, which often brought new ideas to the table. At the same time, I shared my own approach and the benefits of having a structured plan. \n \n We agreed to find a middle ground that leveraged both of our strengths. For example, we implemented short daily check-ins to ensure we were aligned on priorities and deadlines, while still allowing space for spontaneous brainstorming sessions. This compromise not only improved our collaboration but also enhanced our overall team performance. \n \n Through this experience, I learned the importance of empathy, active listening, and flexibility when working with diverse team members. it reinforced my belief that effective communication and mutual respect are key to overcoming differences and achieving common goals. As a result, our project was completed ahead of schedule and received positive feedback from our supervisors.",
